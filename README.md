## 3. FAQ

1. What if I restart the server?
	- The script setup a cron job so the masternode automaticly starts every time when the vps turns on.
1. How to get masternode profit?
	- Enable coin control feature (Settings => Options => Display => Display coin controll feature)
	- Go send tab
	- Select from the input button only the 5 coin lines
	- Click OK
	- You can send selected amount to an address.
	- Note: DO NOT EVER Transfer DXC from that original 1000 deposit or you'll break your Masternode.
1. What is the password for the mn1, mn2, ...mnX accounts?
	- There is no default password. When you create a user it does not have a password yet, so you cannot login with that username until you create a password. There is one other way to act as a new user without its password. As root type `su - mn1`
	- You need to set a password for the user. Use the passwd command: `passwd mn1`
1. I get the following error: "Could not allocate vin"
	- Make sure your wallet fully synced and UNLOCKED.
1. How many masternodes can I run using one IP/server?
	- The limit is only the memory. One masternode requires 150-300MB ram. A server with 1GB memory can run 3 masternodes.
1. My wallet says my masternodes are not running.
	- The wallet will tell you its not running sometimes when it is. If you still receving the masternode rewards then everything is fine.
